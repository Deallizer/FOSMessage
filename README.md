FOSMessage
==========

FOSMessage is a PHP 5.4+ framework-agnostic library providing a data structure
and common features to set up user to user messaging systems.

This library is still being designed: while the basic use-cases are already well known
(extracted from the bundle), the library aims to be much more generic so it can be used
in other contexts.

We are currently working on the missions of the library. If you have any idea, any use-case
or any need, now is the time we need your input! Please give your idea here:

https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSMessage/issues/5

It would be great to use this creation from scratch as an opportunity to solve the issues
of the bundle so please give us your ideas!
